# UMNCalendar

## Introduction

We are a group of students who are studying User Interface Design under Dr. Lana Yarosh. As part of this course project, my team and I are designing a Shared University Calendar for the students at the University of Minnesota. Our team’s goal is to make the experience of finding relevant University events to students easier and more pleasant. Currently, event calendars are scattered, and some student organizations have obscure pages and a limited way to inform students of their events. Mailing lists are difficult to get onto, most students don’t have sufficient information about an event, which results in them usually missing events of their interest. We hope to use your input to make this app one that students will enjoy using. 

## Motivation
- Information overload is a big problem with students. Students are bombarded with posters and e-mails
- At the same time, there’s too little information about events that are actually relevant to them.

### Goal

- Find interesting events quickly!
  - Free food: feeling hungry?
  - Timing: does it fit your schedule?
  - Location: find what's within your reach.
  - Interests: meed with people who share your hobbies.
  - Career: career fairs and on-campus company visits.
- See what your friends are up to.
  - See if your friends are going to the same event.
  - Invite your friends.
