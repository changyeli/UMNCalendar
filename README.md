# UMNCalendar

## Introduction

We are a group of students who are studying User Interface Design under Dr. Lana Yarosh. As part of this course project, my team and I are designing a Shared University Calendar for the students at the University of Minnesota. Our team’s goal is to make the experience of finding relevant University events to students easier and more pleasant. Currently, event calendars are scattered, and some student organizations have obscure pages and a limited way to inform students of their events. Mailing lists are difficult to get onto, most students don’t have sufficient information about an event, which results in them usually missing events of their interest. We hope to use your input to make this app one that students will enjoy using. 

### Goal

- Help the students make more connections and interactions with campus life.
- Enable people to filter events based on their interests, location and time preferences.
- Help people to keep track of and receive notifications about events.
- Integrate the overwhelming information about campus life, including academics, entertainment, professional workshops, employment info-sessions.
